This project aims to create a solver for [wikispeedrun.org](https://wikispeedrun.org/).


WikiSpeedrun is an online game where players navigate from one [wikipedia](https://wikipedia.org/) article to another as 
quickly as possible using only the hyperlinks on the pages. The goal is to start from a 
given article and reach a target article in the fewest clicks and shortest time.

this program was made with love

don't use this program as a cheating tool, 
use it for your curiosity to visualise the network of articles on wikipedia
